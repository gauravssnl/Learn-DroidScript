<p>
A duck made her nest under some leaves.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/007.png"><img src="Img/007.png" alt="THE DUCK'S NEST"></a>
</p>

<p>
She sat on the eggs to keep them warm.
</p>

<p>
At last the eggs broke, one after the other. Little ducks came out.
</p>

<p>
Only one egg was left. It was a very large one.
</p>

<p>
At last it broke, and out came a big, ugly duckling.
</p>

<p>
"What a big duckling!" said the old duck. "He does not look like
us. Can he be a turkey?--We will see. If he does not like the water,
he is not a duck."
</p>

<p>
The next day the mother duck took her ducklings to the pond.

</p>

<p>
Splash! Splash! The mother duck was in the water. Then she called
the ducklings to come in. They all jumped in and began to swim. The
big, ugly duckling swam, too.
</p>

<p>
The mother duck said, "He is not a turkey. He is my own little duck.
He will not be so ugly when he is bigger."
</p>

Then she said to the ducklings, "Come with me. I want you to see the

</p>

<p>
They all went into the duck yard. What a noise the ducks made!
</p>

<p>
While the mother duck was eating a big bug, an old duck bit the ugly
duckling.
</p>

<p>
"Let him alone," said the mother duck. "He did not hurt you."

The mother duck said, "I know he is not pretty. But he is very good."
</p>

<p>
Then she said to the ducklings, "Now, my dears, have a good time."
</p>

<p>
But the poor, big, ugly duckling did not have a good time.
</p>

<p>
The hens all bit him. The big ducks walked on him.
</p>

<p>
The poor duckling was very sad. He did not want to be so ugly. But
he could not help it.
</p>

<p>
He ran to hide under some bushes. The little birds in the bushes were
afraid and flew away.

<p>
"It is all because I am so ugly," said the duckling. So he ran away.
</p>

<p>
At night he came to an old housexx. The housexx looked as if it would fall
down. It was so old. But the wind blew so hard that the duckling went
into the housexx.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/014.png"><img src="Img/014.png" alt="THE UGLY DUCKLING FINDS THE OLD HOUSE"></a>

<p>
An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen.
</p>

<p>
The old woman said, "I will keep the duck. I will have some eggs."

<p>
The next day, the cat saw the duckling and began to growl.
</p>

<p>
The hen said, "Can you lay eggs?" The duckling said, "No."
</p>

<p>
"Then keep still," said the hen. The cat said, "Can you growl?"
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/015.png"><img src="Img/015.png" alt="THE CAT SAID, 'CAN YOU GROWL?'"></a>

<p>
"No," said the duckling.
</p>

<p>
"Then keep still," said the cat.
</p>

<p>
And the duckling hid in a corner. The next day he went for a walk. He
saw a big pond. He said, "I will have a good swim."
</p>

<p>
But all of the animals made fun of him. He was so ugly.

<p>
The summer went by.
</p>

<p>
Then the leaves fell and it was very cold. The poor duckling had a
hard time.
</p>

<p>
It is too sad to tell what he did all winter.
</p>

<p>
At last it was spring.
</p>

<p>
The birds sang. The ugly duckling was big now.
</p>

<p>
One day he flew far away.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/017.png"><img src="Img/017.png" alt="'OH, SEE THE LOVELY SWAN!'"></a>
</p>

<p>
Soon he saw three white swans on the lake.
</p>

<p>
He said, "I am going to see those birds. I am afraid they will kill
me, for I am so ugly."
</p>

<p>
He put his head down to the water. What did he see? He saw himself in
the water. But he was not an ugly duck. He was a white swan.
</p>

<p>
The other swans came to see him.
</p>

<p>
The children said, "Oh, see the lovely swans. The one that came last
is the best."
</p>

<p>
And they gave him bread and cake.
</p>

<p>
It was a happy time for the ugly duckling.

<p>
A little pine tree was in the woods.
</p>

<p>
It had no leaves. It had needles.
</p>

<p>
The little tree said, "I do not like needles. All the other trees in
the woods have pretty leaves. I want leaves, too. But I will have
better leaves. I want gold leaves."
</p>

<p>
Night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came by and gave
it gold leaves.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/020.png"><img src="Img/020.png" alt="THE FAIRY GIVES THE PINK TREE GOLD LEAVES"></a>

<p>
When the little tree woke it had leaves of gold.
</p>

<p>
It said, "Oh, I am so pretty! No other tree has gold leaves."
</p>

<p>
Night came.
</p>

<p>
A man came by with a bag. He saw the gold leaves. He took them all and
put them into his bag.
</p>

<p>
The poor little tree cried, "I do not want gold leaves again. I will
have glass leaves."
</p>

<p>
So the little tree went to sleep. The fairy came by and put the glass
leaves on it.
</p>

<p>
The little tree woke and saw its glass leaves.
</p>

<p>
How pretty they looked in the sunshine! 'No other tree was so bright.
</p>

<p>
Then a wind came up. It blew and blew.
</p>

<p>
The glass leaves all fell from the tree and were broken.
</p>

<p>
Again the little tree had no leaves. It was very sad, and said, "I
will not have gold leaves and I will not have glass leaves. I want
green leaves. I want to be like the other trees."
</p>

<p>
And the little tree went to sleep. When it woke, it was like other
trees. It had green leaves.
</p>

<p>
A goat came by. He saw the green leaves on the little tree. The
goat was hungry and he ate all the leaves.

<p>
And the little tree went to sleep. The fairy gave it what it wanted.

When it woke, it had its needles again. Then the little pine tree
was happy.

<p>
It was very cold. The snow fell and it was almost dark.
</p>

<p>
It was the last day of the year.
</p>

<p>
A little match girl was running in the street. Her name was Gretchen.
She had no hat on.
</p>

<p>
Her feet were bare. When she left home, she had on some big slippers
of her mama's. But they were so large that she lost them when she ran
across the street.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron.
</p>

<p>
She had a little bunch in her hand.
</p>

<p>
But she could not sell her matches. No one would buy them.
</p>

<p>
Poor little Gretchen!
</p>

<p>
She was cold and hungry.
</p>

<p>
The snow fell on her curly hair. But she did not think about that.
</p>

<p>
She saw lights in the houses.
</p>

<p>
She smelled good things cooking.
</p>

<p>
She said to herself, "This is the last night of the year."
</p>

<p>
Gretchen got colder and colder.
</p>

<p>
She was afraid to go home. She knew her papa would whip her, if she
did not take some money to him.
</p>

<p>
It was as cold at home as in the street. They were too poor to have
a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep out the wind.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen did not even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Her little hands were almost frozen.
</p>

<p>
She took a match and lighted it to warm her hands. The match looked
like a little candle.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen thought she was sitting by a big stove. It was so bright.
</p>

<p>
She put the match near her feet, to warm them. Then the light went
out. She did not think that she was by the stove any more.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen lighted another match.
</p>

<p>
Now she thought she could look into a room. In this room was a table.
</p>

<p>
A white cloth and pretty dishes were on the table. There was a roast
turkey, too. It was cooked and ready to eat. The knife and fork were
in his back. The turkey jumped from the dish and ran to the little
girl.
</p>

<p>
The light went out and she was in the cold and dark again.

<p>
Gretchen lighted another match. Then she thought she was sitting by
a Christmas tree. Very many candles were on the tree. It was full
of pretty things.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen put up her little hands. The light went out.
</p>

<p>
The lights on the Christmas tree went up, up--until she saw they
were the stars.

<p>
Then she saw a star fall.
</p>

<p>
"Some one is dying," said little Gretchen.
</p>

<p>
Her grandma had been very good to the little girl. But she was dead.
</p>

<p>
The grandma had said, "When a star falls some one is going to God."
</p>

<p>
The little girl lighted another match. It made a big light.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen thought she saw her grandma. She never looked so pretty
before. She looked so sweet and happy.

<p>
"O grandma," said the little girl, "take me. When the light goes out
you will go away. The stove and the turkey and the Christmas tree all
went away."
</p>

<p>
Then Gretchen lighted a bunch of matches. She wanted to keep her
grandma with her. The matches made it very light.
</p>

<p>
The grandma took the little girl in her arms. They went up, up--where
they would never be cold or hungry.
</p>

<p>
They were with God.

<p>
The next day came.
</p>

<p>
Some men found a little girl in the street. She was dead.
</p>

<p>
In her hand were the burned matches.
</p>

<p>
They said, "Poor little thing, she froze to death."
</p>

<p>
They did not know how happy she was in heaven.

"Red Riding-Hood."
</p>

<p>
One day her mama said, "I want you to take this cake and some butter
to grandma."

<p>
Red Riding-Hood was very glad to go. She always had a good time at
grandma's.

Red Riding-Hood said, "I am going to see my grandma. Mama has made
her a cake and some butter."

"Does she live far?" said the wolf.

"Yes," said Red Riding-Hood, "in the white housexx by the mill."

Once upon a time three of the gods went on a journey.

<p>
One was Thor and one was Loki. Loki was ugly and mean.
</p>

<p>
The gods liked to walk over the hills and rocks. They could go very
fast for they were so big.
</p>

<p>
The gods walked on and on.
</p>

<p>
At last they got very hungry. Then they came to a field with cattle.

Then the gods were very cross.

Some one said, "Give me my share, and I will make the meat cook."

The gods looked to see who was talking. There in an oak tree was a big
eagle.

and there was not much left but the ribs.

<p>
This made Loki cross for he was very hungry. He took a long pole
to hit the eagle. But the pole stuck to the eagle's claws. The other
end stuck to Loki.
</p>

<p>
Then the eagle flew away. He did not fly high. He flew just high
enough for Loki to hit against the stones.

Then Loki knew the eagle was a giant and not a bird.

In this city Idun kept the beautiful golden apples. When the gods
felt they were growing old, they ate the apples and were young again.

The giant wanted to be like the gods. So he said to Loki, "I will

So they made fires on the walls. At last Loki flew over the walls.

Then the gods lighted the fires. The fires blazed up.

Thor was always going on long journeys. One day he went off and left
Sif alone. She went out on the porch and fell asleep.

will fly up to Thor's housexx and get the hammer."

<p>
The next night the Frost Giant flew into the housexx while Thor was
asleep.
</p>

<p>
He took the hammer and flew away with it.
</p>

<p>
When Thor woke, he put out his hand to get the hammer. It was gone.
</p>

<p>
He said, "Loki, the hammer is gone. The Frost Giants have taken it. We
must get it back."

<p>
Loki said, "I can get it back, if Freyja will let me have her falcon
suit."
</p>

<p>
So he went to Freyja and said, "Will you let me have your falcon suit?
I can get the hammer back if you will." Freyja said, "Yes, of course I
will. If I had a gold suit you could have it. Any thing to get the
hammer back."

<p>
When Loki came to the city of the Frost Giants, he took off the falcon
suit. He walked and walked until he came to Thrym's housexx. Thrym was
the giant who took the hammer.

Thrym was sitting on the porch, making gold collars for his dogs.
</p>

<p>
When he saw Loki, he said, "What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
Loki said, "I have come for the hammer."
</p>

<p>
The old giant laughed and said, "You will never get that hammer. It is
buried eight miles deep in the ground.
</p>

<p>
"But there is one way you can get it. I will give you the hammer if
you get Freyja for my wife."

So Loki went back to Asgard.

Thor said, "Well, did you get the hammer?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but we can get it if Freyja will be Thrym's wife."
</p>

<p>
Then they went to Freyja's housexx. They said, "Put on your very best
clothes and come with us. You must be Thrym's wife."
</p>

<p>
Freyja said, "Do you think I will be the Frost Giant's wife? I won't
be his wife."
</p>

<p>
Thor said, "We can get the hammer back if you will."
</p>

<p>
But Freyja said, "No, I will not be his wife."
</p>

<p>
Loki said, "You will have to, if we get the hammer back."
</p>

<p>
Still Freyja said, "I will not go." And she was very angry. She shook
so hard that she broke her necklace and it fell to the floor.

<p>
They said, "Well, that is the only way we can get the hammer back."
</p>

<p>
Thor said, "I do not like to dress like a girl, but I will do it."
Then they dressed Thor up like Freyja.
</p>

<p>
They put on Freyja's dress, necklace and vail, and braided his hair.
</p>

<p>
Loki said, "I will dress up too, and be your servant."

<p>
They got into Thor's goat wagon and went to the Giants' home.

sat down.

The bride ate a whole ox and eight salmon before the others had a

As soon as the hammer was in his lap, Thor tore off the vail.

He took the hammer and whirled it around. Fire flew from it. The

<p>
Long, long ago there lived a king in Greece. He had two little
children, a boy and a girl.
</p>

<p>
They were good children and loved each other very much.
</p>

<p>
One day they were playing in the garden.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Helle, look!" said the boy.
</p>

<p>
There on the grass was a fine large sheep. This sheep had a fleece of
gold and his horns were gold, too.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/103.png"><img src="Img/103.png" alt="THE KING AND HIS TWO CHILDREN"></a>
</p>

<p>
The children wanted to pat the sheep, but they could not catch him.
When they went near, he ran away on the clouds.
</p>

<p>
Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came, too.
</p>

<p>
By and by he grew tame and let the children pat his golden fleece.
</p>

<p>
One day the boy said, "Helle, let us take a ride."
</p>

<p>
First he helped his sister on the sheep's back.
</p>

<p>
Then he got on and held to the horns.
</p>

<p>
"Hold tight to me, Helle," he said.

<p>
The sheep went up, up into the sky, and ran a long way on the clouds.
But Helle got dizzy and fell down into the sea.
</p>

<p>
The boy felt very bad to lose his sister, but went right on.
</p>

<p>
Then he came to the land Colchis. He killed the sheep and gave the
golden fleece to the king.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/106.png"><img src="Img/106.png" alt="THE BOY GIVES THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO THE KING"></a>

<p>
By the tree was a dragon. The dragon never went to sleep. He would not
let any one but the king come to the tree.
</p>

<p>
So no one could get the golden fleece.

<p>
Jason was a brave young man. He lived a little way from the king's
city.
</p>

<p>
One day the king gave a big party and invited Jason.
</p>

<p>
It was a very dark night and it rained hard.
</p>

<p>
Jason had to go across a creek, but there was no bridge.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/109.png"><img src="Img/109.png" alt="JASON COMES TO THE KING'S HOUSE"></a>
</p>

<p>
The creek was full of water and Jason had to wade.
</p>

<p>
One of his shoe-strings came untied and he lost his shoe in the
water.
</p>

<p>
When he came to the king's housexx, he had but one shoe.
</p>

<p>
The king did not like this, for a fairy had said, "The man who shall
come to your housexx with one shoe, will be king."
</p>

<p>
So he knew Jason was to be king.

Then he said to Jason, "You may be king when you bring me the golden
fleece."
</p>

<p>
Jason was glad to go, and asked many brave men to go with him.
</p>

<p>
To get the golden fleece they would have to fight wild men and
animals.
</p>

<p>
They made a big ship which they named "Argo."
</p>

<p>
The men who went on the Argo were called Argonauts.

<p>
The ship Argo sailed a long way. There were two strong men on the
ship. They had wings and could fly.
</p>

<p>
One day the Argo came to a land where the blind king lived.
</p>

<p>
This poor king had a hard time. When he sat down to the table to eat,
some ugly birds called Harpies, came too. The Harpies had skin like
brass and nobody could hurt them. They had claws of iron, and
scratched people when they tried to drive them away.
</p>

<p>
When the king's dinner was ready, the Harpies came and took it away.
When Jason and his men came, the king told them all about it. Jason
said they would help him.
</p>

<a href="Img/114.png"><img src="Img/114.png" alt="JASON TRIES TO KILL THE HARPIES"></a>
</p>

<p>
They cut at the Harpies but could not hurt them.
</p>

<p>
Then the two men with wings flew up in the air. The Harpies were
afraid and flew away. The men flew after them.
</p>

<p>
At last the Harpies grew very tired and fell into the sea and were
drowned.
</p>

<p>
Then the men with wings came back.
</p>

<p>
Now the blind king could eat all he wanted.

<p>
It was now time for Jason and his friends to go away.
</p>

<p>
The king thanked them over and over again for helping him.
</p>

<p>
When they said good-bye, he told them how to get to the land where
they would find the golden fleece.
</p>

<p>
On the sea where Jason and his men had to sail, were two big rocks.
These rocks moved on the waterlike icebergs.
</p>

<p>
They were as high as a big hill. They would come close to each other,
then they would go far apart.

<p>
When fishes swam in the water the rocks would come together and kill
the fishes.
</p>

<p>
If birds flew in the air, the rocks would come together and kill
birds.
</p>

<p>
If a boat sailed on the water, the rocks would come together and break
the boat into little pieces.
</p>

<p>
These rocks had been put in the sea, so no one could go to the land
where the golden fleece was.
</p>

<p>
When the ship Argo came to the rocks, Jason sent a dove out.
</p>

<p>
The rocks came together when the dove was almost past.
</p>

<p>
Then they went far apart. Jason made his men row as hard as they
could.
</p>

<p>
The rocks began to come together. "Row hard, my men," said Jason.
</p>

<p>
Just as they got past, the rocks hit, but Jason and his men were all
right.
</p>

<p>
So they came to Colchis.

When Jason came to Colchis, he went to the king and said, "Will you

<p>
The king wanted to keep the fleece.
</p>

<p>
So he said to Jason, "You may have it, but you must do something
for me first."
</p>

<p>
"You must plow with the brass bulls, and plant the dragon's teeth."
</p>

<p>
The brass bulls looked like real bulls, but they were larger and
stronger.
</p>

<p>
They blew out fire and smoke from their noses and mouths.
</p>

<p>
The bulls had a stall made of iron and stone. They had to be tied
with strong iron chains.
</p>

<p>
When the dragon's teeth were planted, iron men grew up.
</p>

<p>
They always killed the one who had planted them.

<p>
The king wanted the bulls to kill Jason.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/121.png"><img src="Img/121.png" alt="MEDEA GATHERS FLOWERS"></a>
</p>

<p>
He said, "If the bulls do not kill him the iron men will."
</p>

<p>
The king had a daughter named Medea. She saw Jason was a brave
young man and did not want him killed.
</p>

<p>
She knew how to help him. She stepped into her carriage, which was
pulled by flying snakes.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea flew through the air. She went to hills and creeks and
picked all kinds of flowers.
</p>

<p>
She took the flowers home and cooked them.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/123.png"><img src="Img/123.png" alt="MEDEA GIVES JASON THE JUICE"></a>

<p>
When he did this, he was as strong as a giant.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could hurt him then. Fire could not burn him, and swords
could not cut him.
</p>

<p>
The next day Jason had to plow with the brass bulls and plant the
dragon's teeth.

<p>
Early in the morning, the king and princess went out to the place.
</p>

<p>
They had good seats where they could see well.
</p>

<p>
All the people in the city came out to see Jason plow.
</p>

<p>
The little boys climbed the trees so they could see better.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason came to the place. The stall where the brass bulls were
tied was not far off.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened and Jason went in.
</p>

<p>
He untied the bulls and took hold of their horns.
</p>

<p>
Then he made the bulls come out of their stall.

The bulls were very angry and blew fire and smoke from their mouths.
</p>

<p>
This made the cruel king glad. But the people who saw it were afraid.
They did not want Jason killed. They did not know that the princess
had helped him.
</p>

<p>
Jason pushed the bulls' heads down to the ground. Then they kicked at
him with their feet, but could not hurt him.
</p>

<p>
He held their heads down on the ground until the plow was ready.

Jason took the chains in one hand. He took the handle of the plow in
the other.

<p>
The bulls jumped and wanted to run away.
</p>

<p>
But Jason held so hard they had to go very slowly.
</p>

<p>
When it was noon the ground was all plowed.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason let the bulls go.
</p>

<p>
They were so angry that they ran away to the woods.
</p>

<p>
Now Jason went to the king and said, "Give me the dragon's teeth."
</p>

<p>
The king gave him his hat full.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason planted the dragon's teeth, just as a man plants wheat.
</p>

<p>
By this time he was very tired, so he went to lie down.

<p>
In the evening he came back.
</p>

<p>
The iron men were growing up. Some of the men had only their feet in
the ground.
</p>

<p>
Some of them were in the ground up to their knees.
</p>

<p>
Some had only their heads out. They all tried to get out so they could
kill Jason.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason did what Medea told him he should do.
</p>

<p>
He took a giant's marble and threw it near the men.
</p>

<p>
All the iron men wanted to get the marble.
</p>

<p>
So they began to fight each other. As soon as one had his feet out of
the ground, he cut at the man next to him. So they killed each other.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason took his sword and cut off all the heads that were out of
the ground.
</p>

<p>
So all the iron men were killed and the king was very angry.
</p>

<p>
But Medea and the people were glad.

<p>
The next day Jason went to the king and said, "Now, give me the
golden fleece."
</p>

<p>
The king did not give it to him, but said, "Come again."
</p>

<p>
Then Medea said, "If you want the golden fleece, you must help
yourself. My father will not give it to you. A dragon is by the tree
where the golden fleece is, and he never sleeps. He is always hungry
and eats people if they go near him. I can not kill him but I can make
him sleep. He is very fond of cake. I will make some cake and put in
something to make the dragon sleep."
</p>

<p>
So Medea made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the
dragon.
</p>

<p>
The dragon ate them all and went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason climbed over the dragon and took the nail out of the tree.
</p>

<p>
He put the golden fleece under his coat and ran to the ship Argo.
</p>

<p>
Medea went with him and became his wife.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Oh, how angry the king was! He had lost the golden fleece and the
brass bulls and the dragon's teeth. And now his daughter was gone.
</p>



<table summary="stories" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center" width="50%">

<p>
He sent his men in ships to take Jason, but they could not get him.
</p>

<p>
At last Medea and Jason and the other Argonauts came to Greece.
</p>

<p>
Jason's father was there. He was a very old man. Jason wanted his
father to be king, so he asked Medea to make the old man young.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea took her carriage and flew through the air.
</p>

<p>
She did not come back for nine days. She picked flowers from the
hills. She found all kinds of stones, too.
</p>



<table summary="stories" cellpadding="10" border="1" align="center" width="50%">
<tbody><tr><td width="33%">stick</td><td width="33%">died</td><td width="33%">woke</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
When she went home she put all these things into a pot and cooked
them.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/135.png"><img src="Img/135.png" alt="MEDEA MAKES THE OLD KING YOUNG"></a>
</p>

<p>
Then she put a stick into the pot and leaves grew on it.
</p>

<p>
Some of the juice fell on the ground and grass grew up.
</p>

<p>
So Medea knew the juice would make things grow.
</p>

<p>
Jason's father went to sleep and Medea put some of the juice into his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
His white hair turned black and teeth grew in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
When he woke up, he looked and felt like a young man.
</p>

<p>
He lived many years and when he died Jason was king.
